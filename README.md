# Artisanal Reskins: Angel's Mods

**A visual overhaul of Arch666Angel's suite of mods**  
This mod reskins the items, structures, equipment, and technologies added to Factorio by Angel's
Mods, adding tier coloring and labels. As part of this, structures have been re-rendered in high
resolution with Angel's permission (which will eventually be ported into the base Angel's mods).

Note: re-rendering efforts are time consuming and on-going. An initial set of colored sprites have
been prepared for every relevant structure in Angel's suite. As models are re-rendered and updated,
so too will the colored sprites.
